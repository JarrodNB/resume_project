# AGENTS.md — services/ai/agents

## Purpose

Pydantic AI agents, one per file. Each has a Pydantic `output_type` from `schemas/` and its
instructions from `prompts/`.

## Contents

- `resume_parsing_agent.py` — resume text -> `ParsedResume`; `parse_resume_text(text, model)`

## Local Rules

- Create agents with `defer_model_check=True` and pass the model per run (from
  `WorkerSettings`), so importing an agent never needs an API key and tests can override it
  with `agent.override(model=TestModel())`.
- Expose one plain function per agent that handlers and eval runners call.
- Every agent has an eval dataset and runner in `evals/`.
